			<p>A little about me:<br>I am a <em>computer science</em> student with a passion for photography and minimalistic designs. My interests include anything from problem solving to photography/videography. Talking to huge crowds of people and really being able to sell on an idea are some of my strong suits.<br><br>Feel free to browse my website a bit more to get to know me.</p>
